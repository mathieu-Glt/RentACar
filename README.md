## Origin of the project
I decided to make a website to work my skill about database relations, and API requests. I decided to do a "clone" of the Rent a Car website.
Rent a Car is a website who allow users to create ads for car sales. Users can get in touch and add comments to their ads for this they must register.
In this project, I paid attention to respect Symfony coding standard and symfony syntax, and also documentations
